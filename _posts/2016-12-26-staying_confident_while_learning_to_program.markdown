Ahhhh, the famous imposter syndrome, every programmer has been there! As defined by wikipedia, Impostor syndrome (also known as impostor phenomenon or fraud syndrome) is a concept describing high-achieving individuals who are marked by an inability to internalize their accomplishments and a persistent fear of being exposed as a "fraud". My journey to learning how to program had many ups and many more downs where my confidence in switching careers was definitely tested. Often times I would think "Maybe this isn't the right field for me" or "am I stupid for not getting this?". Don't worry we've all been there and its quite nice to hear that other people in similar situations are going through the same thing.

**Don't Worry**

There are times where your confidence will be tested and the trick is to simply get used to it. Being a programmer is all about embracing the unknown. The early stages of learning how to program has many rocky cliffs that will test whether you even want to continue to learn how to program. It's definitely a scary feeling that i've had on multiple occasions after not being able to figure something out quickly but here I am a year later and completely stoked that I got into this field. If you are feeling the same way right now.. Don't worry, we've all been through it! Just keep on keeping on and the confidence will follow!
