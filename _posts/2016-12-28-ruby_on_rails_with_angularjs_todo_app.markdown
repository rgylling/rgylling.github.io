I decided to create a simple CRUD Todo app with Ruby on Rails back-end and Angularjs front-end. This application allows a user to create Todo lists and add todos to that associated list while using Angular to do all my requests without refreshing the page.

**The Take Away**

After building this application with Angular compared to building my other apps with mainly just Ruby on Rails you can tell how much smoother and faster your program is. Its quite amazing how easily and quick Angular was at making api requests compared to doing simple AJAX requests with JQuery. One thing I particularly liked about using angular was there is so many different resources and libraries out that that integrate so simply to Angular. For example I created on page editable text that when a user clicked on the text, they were able to edit the content on the page without refreshing it. I was able to create this feature with quite a bit of html until I googled angular on page editing and found an awesome library called xeditable. I was able to get it running within 5 minutes which I was amazed by. All in all I am exited to harness the power of angular in many more of my up coming applications.
