I decided to create a simple MVC CRUD To-do List App using ActiveRecord with Sinatra. I always like to test my skills with any language by creating a simple application such as a to-do list app. The layout of the app is a little lacking on the user experience side but I really wanted to practice routing with Sinatra, though this app could have definitely been a one page app which was the hardest part for me to let go.

**The Challenge**

The most challenging part of this project was trying to incorporate routing throughout the application since a to-do list app is more like a one page application. This caused me to rebuild several parts of the app after realizing the flow of the app just wasn't there. Originally I had separate pages for editing and deleting the to-do but it just seemed off to me to go to two different pages for each task so I incorporated them both into one page. 

**The Take Away**

I think this project really taught me the importance of scoping and laying out the whole project before jumping in and coding everything. If I just spent an hour really laying the whole project out I think everything would have went much smoother in the long run.
